# Pimp My Job

Rails app built from scratch. For our first team project in LeWagon we decided to solve the problem of connecting a professional with a client directly. In Pimp my Job, anyone with a job that needs doing can advertise it with the corresponding details like a description, a location, a deadline and a budget. Also anyone can choose any job and offer a bid for it's completion, that can accepted or rejected by the client. Once an offer is accepted a direct connection is made thus achieving our goal.
